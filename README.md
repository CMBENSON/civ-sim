\#\# Executive Summary  
Living Planet Civ Sim is a persistent, multiplayer voxel-based civilization simulation set on a dynamic, evolving planet. Players spawn scattered across the world, starting with primitive survival and advancing through emergent gameplay to build societies, economies, and cultures. No scripted quests or lore—history emerges from player actions, environmental changes, and procedural systems. Key features include a living ecosystem with animal AI and biome shifts, player turnover with lasting legacies (ruins, artifacts), layered progression (individual, group, global), and inter-civilization events. The game supports 10–500 concurrent players, long-term engagement (1000+ hours), and modding for community growth.

\*\*Key Innovations\*\*:    
\- Emergent legacies and storytelling from player-driven histories.    
\- Reactive "living planet" with randomized cycles, resource depletion, and adaptations.    
\- Balanced interdependence: Solo play viable for survival, but collaboration essential for advancement.    
\- Non-linear tech tree integrating survival, culture, and diplomacy.    
\- Stylized realism aesthetics to evoke organic, painterly worlds distinct from blocky voxel games.

\*\*Target\*\*: Indie sim fans (e.g., Dwarf Fortress), multiplayer builders (e.g., Minecraft servers), strategy enthusiasts (e.g., Civilization). Age 13+, with optional mature themes (conflict, decay).    
\*\*Platforms\*\*: PC primary (Steam/itch.io), consoles secondary (Xbox/PlayStation), possible mobile lite companion.    
\*\*Engine\*\*: Godot 4.3+ (voxel-friendly, open-source).    
\*\*Timeline\*\*: 12–24 months, with early access potential.    
\*\*Budget\*\*: \~$5,000 for art/assets, $500/month for servers.    
\*\*Monetization\*\*: One-time purchase or free with cosmetic DLC (e.g., cultural banners, auras).

\#\# 1\. Game Overview  
\#\#\# 1.1 Concept Evolution from Chat History  
Originated as a simple voxel generation script (Python-based OBJ exporter for 3D models). Evolved into a cute survival sim with RuneScape-inspired XP systems (code provided but scrapped for organic proficiency). Shifted to a serious civilization simulator mimicking Earth's scattered histories, emphasizing professions, discoveries, migrations, and environmental dynamics. Refinements included planetary "pulse" for events, cultural evolution, death/succession mechanics, animal AI (no human-like natives), dynamic resources/biomes, interdependence, a pillar-based tech tree, and stylized realism to differentiate from Minecraft. Godot prototyping encountered issues (e.g., gray screens, nonexistent functions), leading to a focus on conceptual solidification before code resumption.

\#\#\# 1.2 High-Level Description  
Players awaken on a procedurally generated, cylindrical planet, scavenging resources and honing skills through actions. As groups form, settlements evolve from camps to kingdoms, with trade, diplomacy, and conflict emerging naturally. The planet "lives"—biomes shift, animals migrate, resources deplete—forcing adaptation and migration. Death triggers succession, leaving artifacts and ruins for future players to discover, creating layered histories. The thrill: Observing emergent "what if" scenarios in a shared, persistent world.

\#\#\# 1.3 Target Audience and Platforms  
\- \*\*Audience\*\*: Deep sim enthusiasts, social experiment fans, creative builders/storytellers.    
\- \*\*Platforms\*\*: PC (primary), consoles (Xbox, PlayStation), mobile lite (for viewing worlds or basic interactions).    
\- \*\*Monetization\*\*: Cosmetic DLC or one-time fee; no pay-to-win.

\#\#\# 1.4 Objectives and Scope  
\- \*\*Objectives\*\*: Foster emergent narratives; build a reactive, living world; balance survival, collaboration, and legacy; enable modding for longevity.    
\- \*\*Scope\*\*: Multiplayer-focused (server-authoritative), procedural generation, modular systems. MVP includes world gen, proficiency, animal AI, migration, and basic settlements. Excludes: Initial mobile full version, complex AI for non-animal entities.

\#\# 2\. Gameplay Pillars  
1\. \*\*Emergent Storytelling\*\*: Player actions and systems generate unique histories (e.g., a trade dispute sparks war, leaving ruins).    
2\. \*\*Living Planet\*\*: Ecosystems, biomes, and resources adapt dynamically to player impact and cycles.    
3\. \*\*Interdependence\*\*: Solo survival possible, but group collaboration unlocks advanced tech and civs.    
4\. \*\*Legacy & Turnover\*\*: Player departure leaves persistent ruins, artifacts, and cultural echoes for continuity.    
5\. \*\*Stylized Realism\*\*: Organic voxels with painterly lighting, atmospheric effects, and immersive audio.

\#\# 3\. Core Gameplay Loop  
1\. \*\*Explore/Scavenge\*\*: Gather resources, hunt, mine voxels in dynamic biomes.    
2\. \*\*Improve\*\*: Build proficiency through repeated actions and experiments.    
3\. \*\*Collaborate\*\*: Form groups, trade, build/defend settlements.    
4\. \*\*Adapt\*\*: Respond to environmental shifts, depletion, or events via migration.    
5\. \*\*Evolve\*\*: Advance personal/group/global progression through eras.    
6\. \*\*Discover\*\*: Unearth ruins and artifacts from past players for boosts and lore.

\#\# 4\. World Design  
\#\#\# 4.1 Structure  
\- Finite grid: 1024x1024 voxels (expandable via mods).    
\- Cylindrical wrapping (east-west seamless for circumnavigation; no north-south wrap).    
\- Organic voxels: Blended/rounded edges, curved transitions, structural realism (e.g., over-mining causes collapses).    
\- Chunk management: 16x16x256 streaming for performance, loaded around players.

\#\#\# 4.2 Biomes  
Generated from noise maps (height, temperature, moisture, elevation). Each has unique resources, risks, and visuals:    
\- \*\*Plains\*\*: Grazing animals, food crops; ideal for festivals.    
\- \*\*Forests\*\*: Wood, herbs; hidden ruins and ambushes.    
\- \*\*Deserts\*\*: Gems, spices; shifting sands bury structures.    
\- \*\*Mountains\*\*: Ores, fog; avalanches and landslides.    
\- \*\*Jungles\*\*: Exotic fruits, vines; flooding and pests.    
\- \*\*Tundra\*\*: Furs, auroras; cracking ice and hypothermia.    
\- \*\*Swamps\*\*: Toxins, rare plants; sinking risks.    
\- \*\*Oceans/Rivers/Lakes\*\*: Fish, storms; dynamic water flow (rivers downhill, lakes in basins).

\#\#\# 4.3 Atmosphere  
\- \*\*Visuals\*\*: Muted earthy tones with vibrant accents; painterly effects (bloom, fog, depth of field, volumetrics).    
\- \*\*Audio\*\*: Biome-specific ambiences (e.g., wind in plains, echoes in mountains); dynamic weather/event music.

\#\# 5\. Planetary Cycles and Environmental Systems  
\- \*\*Cycles\*\*: Randomized (not timed) for unpredictability; stored persistently (e.g., via SimClock.gd). Examples: Ice Ages (snow expansion), Droughts (drying lakes), Volcanic Surges (ash/fertility), Magnetic Shifts (auroras/migrations).    
\- \*\*Pulse\*\*: Global health metric triggers events; offline evolution possible.    
\- \*\*Adaptation\*\*: Biomes/animals evolve (e.g., overhunting causes extinction/migration).    
\- \*\*Degradation\*\*: Structures erode over time; faster in harsh biomes (e.g., swamp decay).    
\- \*\*Nodes\*\*: Finite resource spots spawn/fade, creating scarcity and migration pressure; echoes hint at past locations.

\#\# 6\. Progression System  
\#\#\# 6.1 Individual Proficiency  
\- Grows via repetition (diminishing returns); breakthroughs from item combinations.    
\- Traits emerge behaviorally (e.g., frequent migration grants speed bonuses).

\#\#\# 6.2 Group/Civ Traits & Tech  
\- Unlocked collectively (e.g., group mining unlocks alloys); spreads via trade/migration.

\#\#\# 6.3 Global Eras  
\- 12+ phases: Dawn → Stone → Bronze → Iron → Medieval → Industrial → Digital → Transcendence.    
\- Triggers: Milestones (e.g., total voxels mined); no fanfare—subtle shifts (new resources, animal evolutions).    
\- Impacts: Biome changes, tech availability.

\#\#\# 6.4 Balance  
\- Catch-up: Echo mechanics, era bonuses for new players.    
\- Interdependence: Groups accelerate progress; solos fill niches (e.g., nomadic traders).

\#\# 7\. Death & Succession  
\- \*\*Causes\*\*: Starvation, combat (player-driven), hazards (e.g., avalanches).    
\- \*\*Succession\*\*: Respawn with 50% skill inheritance; spawn in suitable areas (potentially distant, forcing migration). Lineage improves inheritance over generations.    
\- \*\*Impact\*\*: Inventory scatters (decays slowly); settlements degrade faster into ruins with artifacts (subtle lore hints).

\#\# 8\. Animal AI & Ecosystems  
\- \*\*Types\*\*: Biome-specific (e.g., bison herds in plains, predators in jungles).    
\- \*\*Behaviors\*\*: Grazing, flocking, hunting, migrating; adapts to player impact (overhunting triggers extinction/migration).    
\- \*\*Domestication\*\*: Possible (e.g., for mounts/farms) but reversible if neglected.    
\- \*\*Impact\*\*: Provide food/furs; pose hazards; guide player migrations. Server-authoritative for sync.

\#\# 9\. Migration & Settlements  
\- \*\*Triggers\*\*: Resource depletion, biome shifts, overpopulation, animal migrations, mass death.    
\- \*\*Evolution\*\*: Camps → Villages → Towns → Cities → Kingdoms; multi-site civs possible.    
\- \*\*Legacy\*\*: Abandoned sites degrade into lootable ruins with artifacts.

\#\# 10\. Groups, Kingdoms & Diplomacy  
\- \*\*Formation\*\*: Bond scores from shared actions (e.g., co-building).    
\- \*\*Territory\*\*: Claimed via voxel markers (provide buffs; contestable via conflict).    
\- \*\*Kingdoms\*\*: Governance structures (e.g., councils, elections, thrones for perks).    
\- \*\*Diplomacy/Conflict\*\*: Emergent alliances, trade pacts, wars; balances interdependence.

\#\# 11\. Inter-Civ Events  
\- \*\*Resource Surge\*\*: Temporary node booms, sparking competition.    
\- \*\*Great Migration\*\*: Mass relocations due to shifts.    
\- \*\*Climate Shift\*\*: Biome conversions (e.g., plains to desert).    
\- \*\*Trade Boom\*\*: Cultural flourishing and exchanges.

\#\# 12\. Art & Architecture Systems  
\- \*\*Art\*\*: 2D (pigments on surfaces) and 3D (voxel sculpting); persists as cultural artifacts in ruins.    
\- \*\*Architecture\*\*: Evolves with eras/materials; risks collapses or biome effects (e.g., faster decay in swamps). Cultural styles emerge per civ/biome.

\#\# 13\. Visual & Audio Style  
\- \*\*Visuals\*\*: Stylized realism with organic voxels, blended biomes, GI lighting, atmospheric effects (storms, auroras).    
\- \*\*Audio\*\*: Immersive soundscapes (biome ambiences, weather audio); event-based dynamic music.

\#\# 14\. Development Framework  
\#\#\# 14.1 Architecture  
\- \*\*Engine\*\*: Godot 4.3+ with ECS for modularity.    
\- \*\*Networking\*\*: Godot Multiplayer (server-authoritative).
